## Problem Scenarios 

NAME: NEHA GAUR 

Part : 1 ( Rating a professor)  

Neha Gaur completed her Bachelor’s in Computer Science from New York University. 
She then started working at Goldman Sachs at New York. She is a bright student and 
got recruited from Career Fair at college as Java Full Stack developer. She really 
liked her job at the start but later she realized that she wants to do her master’s 
in data science, which she wants to pursue as she holds interest in it. She wants to 
do her Master’s in Data Science from New Jersey Institute of Technology. She got admission 
at NJIT and really excited about her Graduate degree. She wants to find evening classes 
and professors that teach well which can enhance her skills and help her get a job 
in Data Science. After she started her school at NJIT, she took a professor for Data Mining class. 
But that professor was very strict. She didn’t like him and decide to change her class.  
 
Part 2: (Finding a project partner) 
 
She is in search for classmates who lives near to her house or are adjusting as she will 
only be able to meet on weekend or in late evening. She wants people who respects work and 
understands if she is not able to show up on some days even after making plan due to 
excessive work in project. She wants to make mini projects which can help her get 
acquainted with new tools in market and keep herself up-to-date. She needs group mates who 
share same interest. Students and Professors at NJIT use applications to rate and review 
professors so she plan to use one of that application to get answers to all her doubts and 
succeed in this graduate program.  

## Steps to use the application

Part 1:

 - She opens the app and starts searching for professors teaching Data Science at NJIT. 
   She finds out two professors who teach the subject. She was taking class under one 
   of the professors. She explores the other professor by looking at the reviews given 
   to him by students. Many students posted review such as lenient professor, easy grader,
   simple lectures, co-operative. She than compared the two professors on basis of ratings
   given to professor by students. To strengthen her thoughts about switching the professor
   she looked for comments given students. She related one of the comment to her current 
   situation and found that comment similar and genuine. Hence, the comparison of both the 
   professors dictated her decision. 
 
 - All this information was important for Neha because without that she would not have been 
   able to makeup her decision. Without the information like comments, reviews or ratings, 
   it is not possible for Neha to reach a decision.  
 
 - Then Neha decides to give a review to this bad professor.  

Part 2:

 - She opens the app and starts searching for students in Data mining class at NJIT. She 
   finds out two students. 
 
 - Then she opens one of the student’s profile and checks the reviews and comments. 
 
 - Then she goes back and again go the another student's profile. 
 
 - She checks another student’s profile.  
 
 - But because of the mix reviews she couldn’t decide which student to pick.  
 
 - But still she was able to see the student’s reviews and decide to talk to
   both the students personally
